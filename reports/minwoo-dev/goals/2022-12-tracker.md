7. **2022-12-12** - It has been a while since I last pushed something into this repository but it is good to be back! A lot have happened BUT I am so glad I am back on track! I am now on Day 51 of the 100 Days of code and it was really refreshing to relearn the knowledge you have learned before. I just finished coding a while ago and I am ready to tackle Day 52 tomorrow! So for now, I will just review my previous codes and see which parts I till don't understand. JLPT N1 was really difficult. Not expecting anything but I know I did what I can. I can take up studying other languages now. Cheerio!
8. **2022-12-16** - I am now on Day 55 of the 100 Days of Code and I am feeling excited to be able to finish it soon! I have to double my time in studying because I feel like my pace is slow. I learned how to auto-save and auto-read (auto-load) a file, organize data with a little bit of calculation, create a program to backup files into a path and reading (loading) CSV files into a program and manipulating data to display it as a readable output. There is a month and a few days to go so I'll probably finish this right away by doing two at a time instead of just one. Will also do supplemental reading.
9. **2022-12-19** - Finally on Day 57! I just learned recursion a while ago and I am still wrapping my head around it, if that phrase is correct.
10. **2022-12-20** - Used REPLIT's built-i debugger to see how a program is in action and how it ables to detect bugs while the program is running. Learned about the algorithm to check whether a word is a palindrom or not using three concepts that I have studied during the course: looping, slicing, and recursion. Will be studying the library datetime on Day 60.
11. **2022-12-26** - Finished Day 61 and 62 on the same day to catch up with the days that I have missed. Review string slicing.
12. **2022-12-27** - Learned how to create a separate .py file that will serve as the library where I can store all of the functions or subroutines for a main program. Today, I have decided to use the toDoListManagerUp.py because it has a lot of code in it and I want to make the code of the main.py file shorter and "cleaner", if I may say.
